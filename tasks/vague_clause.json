        "expected_output": "Vagueness arises from:\n- 'At its sole discretion' gives the Company unchecked control with no criteria.\n- 'Commercially viable or appropriate' are subjective terms with no measurable standard.\n- 'Prevailing circumstances' is broad and undefined, allowing arbitrary interpretation.\nThese elements introduce risk and lack predictability, particularly for machine interpretation.",
